## What is it?

In 61A, the correctness of a program was our primary goal. In CS61B, weâ€™re concerned also with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. Weâ€™ll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.
